xviii INPRODUO'PION

Alcithoe will tell ne commen story, such as that ol
the shepherd Daphnis turned te stone bya jealous
nymph, er of calmis, enee the faithful friend ef the
child Jupiter, afterwards fer an indiscretien turned
te adamant, er the birth of the Curetes irem a
shewer ol rain, or of the transformatien ei Crocus
and Smilax to the flewers which hear their names.
Her cheice is the story ef Salmacis and Hermaphro
ditus.

‘Se closed their tales r-and still the Minyada plied
Their teil, and seorned the god, and mec ed his feast'

But as they sit in the twilight the walls are rocked
by earthquake, and amid unearthly sights and sounds
strange metamorphosis cemes upon themselves and

their werlr z

‘sudden green
ef ivy wool and we e’erspread s—the wool
Budded· in twig end esf s-the threads they drew
ln teudrils curled ;-and berry and buueh ef vine
O’er all the leem in purple elusters glowed...
Trembling the sistere separate fly, and sach,
Apart, seme lurking place by that fierce blare
Unlighted strives to gain. But, as she hides,
Strsnge, delicate, membraneus, a subtle film
Her shrunken limbs e’erspreads, with thinucat down
Clothing her wing-like arms. How all the change
Was wreught es shape aud nature, net themselves
Oeuld, in the darkness, tell 3—the change alone
They know. Ne feathers heve they, yet they ily
Borne eu transparent piniens. ror all speech
Such twitter as their tiny ferm belits
Mustservethem new. With seeblest shriek theirplaint
They utter; ner in woods but round the reess
And harrnts es men flit ni htly s—fees te Neon

And friends ef Eva—ef asper justly named.’¹
