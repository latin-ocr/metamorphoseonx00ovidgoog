Νοιὶοο that qne is joined not to tecta which it connects with
rnatum, but ιο ιιο ο ithet of deae which helon to both
clauses. Dillenburger das pointed out that this col oration of
quc as wellas of no and oe is a feature of the style of Horace.
See a list of passages in Wickham’s noteou 0. I. xxx. 6, where
he says: ‘ln all these cases the word to which it isjoiuedis
emphatic, suad1 is zeus& d commonhelement in the two clauses,
&fficgesrlgipolzcedriegthz vcmygrres t err meamng to both, and
feei their unity.' lt seems doubtful whether the effectis not
rather ιο emphasise the second member of the coordination, for

which the ear is thus kept waiting. cf. 19, ra, ΧΙΙΙ. 913, a.

447. nubilus umbra, ‘ouercast with umbrage.’ umbra
seems to be used of ‘shady foliage,' as in Virg. 9. 1. 157, ruris
opoeisoloe pronos umbram. Cf. Virg. Aere. VII. 29-32.

452. Tyr-thenis tota. Korn refers this ιο the Rutulians
as aliied with Mezentius, king of Caere, natio ιο ιιο united
forces of Latius and Trojans. There are several objections to
thie. Orid is following the narrative of Virgil, in which the
Latine, against the wishes and better judgment of their king,

utulians the aid of 1‚ooo men, he is at the time in exile, and
his subjecto, or, es Virgil expresses it, mucis Etruria (Aere.
1111. 494), with the exception of a contingent under Messapus
