INTRODUOTION.

Tun Metamorphoses in fifteen books were written
by Ovid in the years immediately preceding his
banishment at the age of fifty, 8 An. At that date
the poem, though complete, still needed revision,¹
and in his despair and grief the poet burned it. But
there were already copies in the hands ol others, and
Ovid himself lived to rejoioe that his design was

frustrated. One of the friends who remained faith-
ful to him, identified only as Brutus, undertook

the publication ol this poam among others, and Ovid
