BOOK XIII. 83

Ulysses, predictsd thet Troy could never be taken bnt bytho
errove oi Herculos; upon this, messengers were sent to Lemnos
in ordor to bring back Philoctetes with his amous to rroyff’
There are many variations in the story of Philoctetes; I have
taken the above version from Wundesss edition of Sophocles.

40. nostro cum crimine, ‘to our reproach.' Onon ⁶
frequently thus introduces the results which attend action. cf.
Cic, in Oai. 1. xiii. ἕ 33, Haece minitrat, Gothico, mam commo
republicae colcu, cum tua pecte oc manno mamque coriam
mut, Μ’ aa teoscm mnna' scolere poanudioqae temerant, pro·
flectam cul impiam bellum aa nefarium.

40. nt dl nunt, ‘il thare be gods, as gode there are! But
itis to be observed that the asserticn is not involved by tho
torm oi the sentence, bnt only by the nature ci its contente.
Latin malros no distinction between a condition such as this,
and one which is merely assumed for the sake of argument,
as in Cic. Tsoac. Ι. xi 24, nom ec’ coo· orat aaronis out ccrebnan
