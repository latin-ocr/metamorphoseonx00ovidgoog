INTRODUCTION xxv

opening of the poem and the lost books, in which a
higher tone becomes more plainly audible, Ovid has
placed no very severe constraint upon his genius.
His supreme gift iethet oi telling a story brilliantly
and vigorously. The metamorphoses when they are
described at all, are described with uniailing in=
genuity and inexhaustiblevariety.1 But Ovid has
given most care to the stories themselves, sometimes
to stories which are only indirectly connected with
metamorphoses at all. The suit for the arms oi
Achilles occupies nearly four hundred lines, oi which
only five suffice for the incident which justifies its
introduction. The story oi Phaethon is told in more*
than three hundred, before we come to his sistere the
Heliades, who in their grief are changed to poplars.

Every passion of the human mind, every scene of

human lile is described in turn.² The stories are
crowded with detail, often ianciiul, sometimes play-
ful, but always virid and pictoresque. In Deucalion’s
flood⁸ the husbandmen turned mariner anchore his
boat where

‘Some rineyard grates with hidden poles the keel,’

² 'I'he greatest skill is shown in the adaptation part by pert of
the old form to the new, as in the transformation of the Trojon
shipsto seo-nymphe (XIV. 549). In the story ol Ocyroe the poet
ossastep further: 'hergarment'strain floatsinatail’ (11. 672).
lut as Gierig points out, equal skill is shown in describing the
change to what has no parts, rock or water. See sor the former
Il. 820, IV. 551,V1. 3033 for the latter V. 428, 632.
¹ Orid is as successful with cottoge interiore os with the
Palace of the Suu or the Tem le of Fame, witness the three
soenes of rustic hospitality ipI {1915 333, Fert. IV. 509, V.
