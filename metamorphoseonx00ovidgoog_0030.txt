INPRODUOPION xv

a collection ol storias, which, though possibly con-
tinuone in form, possessed no artistic unity.

It is the possession ol artistic unity, quite spart
from their brilliancy ol detail, which so distinctly
stampe the Metamorphoses as en original work From
the first metamorphosis, which brings Ooemoe out of
Chaos, to the laet, which changes to a ster the seul
, oi the murdered Caesar, the whole series oi legende
, ie eo connected ae to present a kind oi continuone
⁷ history ol the world. In the last three books thie
history becomes that of the founding andriae of
Rome, the city, quanto aee est aec erit nec oisc priori-
bus eoam, the whole finding its culmination and
perlection in the reign ior a while on earth of the
greater than ansur, the vicegerent, almost the aquai,
of Jupiter, Augustus.

The poem has also a philosophical unity, lor this
record of Evolution ae it is in Wonderland leads up
to the revelation by Pythagoras ol Obange and
Growth as the fundamental and eternal lawe of the
universe, expressed in the twin doctrines of mets-
norphosie and metempsychosis with their attendant
practioal gospel ol vegetarianism:
