INTRODUOPION xxv

opening of the poem and the lest books, in which a
higher tone becomes more plainly audible, Ovid has
placed no very severe constraint upon his genius.

His supreme gift is that ol telling a story brilliantly
and vigorously. The metamorphoses‚ when they are
described at all, are described with unfailing in=
genuity and inexhaustible variety.¹ But Ovid has
given most care to the stories themselves, sometimes
to stories which are only indirectly connected with
metamorphoses at all. The suit for the arms of
Achilles occupies nearly four hundred lines, of which
only five suffice for the incident which justifies its
introduction. The story ol Phaethon is told in more¹
than three hundred, before we come to his sisters the
Heliades, who in their grief are changed to poplars.
Every passion ol the human mind, every scene ol
human life is described in turn.2 The stories are
crowded with detail, often lanciful‚ sometimes play·
ful, but always vivid and picturesque. In Deucalion's
flood⁸ the husbandmen turned mariner anchors his
boat where

‘Some vineyord grates with hidden poles the koel,’

¹ 'I'he greatest skill is shown in the adaptation part by part of
the old form to the new, as in the transformation of the Trojan
ships to sea-nymphs (XIV. 549). In the story of Ocyroe the poet
astep further: ‘hergurment’strain floatsina tail’ (ΙΙ. 672).
ut as Gierig points out, eque] skill is shown in describing the
change to what has no parts, rock or water. See sor the former
II. 820, IV. 551,V1. 3033 for the latter V. 428, 632.
