xxx INPRODUOTION

¹ additions and scholia by various hands from the
twelfth century to the fifteenth.¹

[As a whole', M, from the time of Heinsius to the Ἴ
latest editions of Merkel, Korn, and Zingerle, has

been and is still considered the best and least inter· ¹
polated source of the text of the Metamorphoses. But
when we have as early or even earlier fragments of
MSS. to compare with it, or where a MS. is found ’
which, with some variations seems closely to follow
in the track of M, it is necessary to weigh the read-
ings of these other MSS. side hy side with M before ἵ
pronouncing on the text of any given passage. Of
such fragments there are two in the British Muscum‚
one ot Paris, one at Leipzig, one at Berne 3 while
in Can. VH. we possess a complete codex ol the four-
teenth century, which on the whole closely reproduces
many of the features of M.
These fragments of MSS. of the Metamorphoses are

as followst

· III. 1-510, IV. aaa-803, V. 1-389, tas-678, VI. 1-412.
