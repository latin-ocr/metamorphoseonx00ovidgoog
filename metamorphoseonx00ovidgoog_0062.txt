INPRODUOTION xxvii

X Perseus for safety wraps his perilous trophy in sea·
need, which straightway hardens¹

‘into stony leaf and stalk.
Woudering the Sea Nympho saw-and with fresh gromh
Of Ocean made experiment, and lauglred
At like results dohghted and wide strowed
Around their watery realm the novel seeds.'’

Not less ingenuity is shown in conoeits, as when
Boreas flies away with Orithyia? and the flama ol
his love is blown to fiercer heat by the rapidity ol
his flight, or in such play of language as the combi-

Medea to kill their father in hope of his restoration
to youth,

The oxymoron is perfect, hut it palls on repetition,
and it is repeated more or less closely at least three
times. Itisthis facile felicity4 which has betrayed Ovid
into the affectation and repetition most frequently
charged against him. He seems to take pleasure in
