INTRODUOPION xix

The fame of Bacchus waxed greater than ever, and
his mother's sister Ino, wife of Athamas and daughter
of Cadmus, drew upon herself the wrath of J uno by
boasting of her divine nursling. The angry goddess
resolves to visit her, as Bacchus had visited her sister
Agave, with madness, and seeks amid the terrore of
the nether world the help of Tisiphone. The Fury v
immediately journeys to the palaoe of Athamas, who,
with bis wife, is maddened by her presence. He
takes Ino for a lioness, and snatching what he deems
her cub, his child Learchus, dashes it to piaces against
a rock Ino seizes their other child Melicertes, and
dying in Bacchic trenay flings herself with him from
a cliff into the sea. Venus, in pity for her daughter's
grandson and his mother, prays Neptune to change
them to sea-deities, when they receive the new names
of Leucothea and Palaemon.l The Theben matrone,
in grief for the ruin of the house of Cadmus, impeach
the justice of Juno's vengeance, and, as they would
follow their mistress in the frantie leap, are changed
by her anger to rocks and birds. Old Cadmus never
knew how this last sorrow had been changed to
blassing, and broken by many ssls fied with his wife
Harmonia to Illyria. There he prays that any
wengeance yet due for the sacred dragon he killed in
youth may be visited upon himself by transformation
to the serpent shepe. His prayer is granted, as is
Harmonia’s, that even this change may not divide
