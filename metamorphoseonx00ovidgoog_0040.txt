INPRODUOPION xxv

opening ol the poem cnd the last books, in which a
higher tone becomes more plainly audible, Ovid has
placed no very severe constraint upon his genius.
His supreme gift is that of telling a story brilliantly
and vigorously. The metamorphoses, when they are
described at all, are described with uniailing in-
genuity and inexhaustible variety.1 But Ovid has
given most care to the stories themselves, sometimes
to stories which are only indirectly connected with
metamorphoses at all. The suit for the arms oi
Achilles occupies nearly four hundred lines, of which
only five suffice for the incident which justifies its
introduction. The story of Phaethon is told in more¹
than three hundred, before we come to his sistere the
Heliades, who in their grief are changed to poplars.
Every passion of the human mind, every scene of
human life is described in turn.² The stories are
crowded with detail, often fanoiful, sometimes play-
ful, but always vivid and picturesque. In Deucalion’s
flood⁸ the husbandmen turned meriner anchors his
boat where
‘Some vineysrd gretes with hidden poles the beel,'

the old form to the new, as in the transformation ol the hojrn
ships to sea-nymphs (Xl V. 549). 111 the story of Ocyroethe poet

change to what has no parts, rock or water. See sor the former

soenes os rustic hospitality ip1 {I} ξὸῡ, Fert. IV. 509, V.
