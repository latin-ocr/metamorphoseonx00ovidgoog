INTRODUC'TION xxix

It remains to say a lew words as to the MSS.
referred to. Korn believes that all existing MSS.
are derived from an archetype which itself repre· l
sented a second recension of the poem, made towards
the end 01 the eighth century. This archetype,
which is most nearly reproduced by the (lodex
Marcianus (M), was itself not 1000 froin corruption 0
and interpolation. But all other conplete or nearly
complete MSS. represent a still later recension, in
which the process 01 interpolation has gone much ’-
further. 01 these, which 000 01000οᾶ 00 Codices 00000· ⁴
001011, the oldest and most valuable is Laurentianus l
(10οο λ), in the Laurentian Library at Florence.

This ie 01 the eleventh or twellth century. 01 the ⁴
two others collated by Korn, Amplonianus (Εο0 ε) L

and Hauniens'is¹ (H or h), both of the thirteenth A„
century, and preserved respectively.at Erfurc and
Oopenhagen, the former is more extensively inter
polated, while the latter approximates to L. The -- l
Codex Marcianus,'formerly in the Dominican 000·
vent 01 St„ Mark at Florence,² and now in the
laurentian Library, contains the poem as 100 00 Γ,
XIV. 830, together with the prose arguments 01 .,
