INTRODUOI'ION xxiii

hatred by slaying his eleven brothers, one of them,
Periclymenus, in spite oi his Protean power of
changing his shape at will.

Nor is this the only form of transition repeatedly
adopted by Ovid. Another method is to introduce
storias as told by spectatore, sometimes to convince
the incredulous, sometimes, like the story of Aesacos
already mentioned, because some similarity iu the
catastrophe prompts their recollection. Pirithous
doubts the metamorphosis of Perimele narreted by
Achelous‚¹ but is silenced by Lelex, who relates the
story of Baucis and Philemon, whereupon Achelous
himself gives further proof of the divine power. The
fate of Niobe recalls another instance of Latona's
vengeance,² the transformation to frogs of the Lycian
peasants who insulted her, and again the fate of
Marsyas, flayed alive by her son Apollo and meta
morphosed to a river. Or a story is told within a
story by way of warning or encouragement.⁸ The
erow endeavours to deter the raven from revealing
to Apollo the faithlessnessof Coronis, by relating the
disgrace inflicted by Pallas upon herself for a like
indiscretion. Sometimes a journey gives occasion for

adventures or ellows the introduction of local
legenda⁴ such as the historias of Scylla, the Sibyl,

¹ VIII. 614. ² VI. 316.

’As the stories of Galatea XIII. 740, end of Iphis and
Anaxarete XIV. 698.

⁴ These local legenda ere sometimes very brielly told, like
thet of the Molossian king, ΧΙΙΙ. 717. Α notsble instance of
Elpis ps inhVII. 350, where seventsen stories are mentioned in
