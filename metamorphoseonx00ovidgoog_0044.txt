INTRODUOTION xix

'Phe fame of Bacchus waxed greater than ever, and
his mother’s sister Ino, wife of Athamas and daughter
of Cadmus, drew upon herself the wrath of J uno by
boasting of her divine nursling. The angry goddess
resolves to visit her, as Bacchus had visited her sister
Agave, with madness, and seeks amid the terrors of
the nether world the help of Tisiphone. 'lhe Fury
immediately journeys to the palaea of Athamas, who,
with his wife, is maddened by her presence. He
takes Ino for a lienem, and snatching what he deems
her cub, his child learchus, dashes it to pisces against
a rock. Ino seizes their other child Melicertes, and
dying in Bacchis frenzy flings herself with him from
a cliff into the sea. Venus, in pity for her daughter's
grandson and his mother, prays Neptune to change
them to sea-deities, when they receive the new names
of Leucothea and Palaemon.¹ The Theban matrone,
in grief for the ruin of the house of Cadmus, impeach
the justice of Juno's vengeance, and, as they would
follow their mistress in the frantie leap, are changed
by her anger to rocks and birds. Old Cadmus never
knew how this last sorrow had been changed to

blessing, and broken by many ills fied with his wife
Harmonia to Illyria. There he prays that any
vengaance yet due for the sacred dragon he killed in
youth may be visited upon himself by transformation
to the serpent shape. His prayer is granted, as is
Harmonia's, that evanthis change may not divide
