INTRODUOTION xxiii

hatred by slaying his eleven brothers, one oi them,
Periclymenus, in spite oi his Protean power of
changing his shepe et will.

Nor is this the only form of transition repeatedly
adopted by Ovid. Another method is to introduce
stories as told by spectatore, sometimes to convince
the ineredulous, sometimes, like the story ol Assorus
already mentioned, because some similarity in the
catastrophe prompte their recollection. Pirithous
doubts the metamorphosis ol Perimele narreted by
Achelous,¹ but is silenced by Lelex, who relatos the
story oi Baucis and Philemon, whereupon Achelous
himself gives further proof of the divine power. The
fate ol Niobe recalls another instance of Latona's
vengeance,² the transformation to frogs ol the Lysian
peasants who insulted her, and again the fate of
Marsyas, flayed alive by her son Apollo and meta
morphosed to a river. Or a story is told within a
story by way of warning or encouragement.⁸ The
crow endeavours to deter the raven from revealing
to Apollo the iaithlessness oi Coronis, by relating the
disgrace inflieted by Pallas upon herself for a like
indiscretion. Sometimes a journey gives occasion ior
adventures or allows the introduction of local

legends,⁴ such as the histories oi Scylla, the Sibyl,

¹ Vlll. 614. ² V1.31o.

³As the stories of Galatea XIII. 740, and oi Iphis and
Anaxareto XIV. 698.

⁴ These local legende are sometimes very brielly told, like
thet of the Molossian king, Xlll. 717. Anotable instance of
this is in Vll. 350, where serenteen stories are mentioned in
fifty-four lines.
