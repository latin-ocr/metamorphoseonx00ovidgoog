INPRODUOTION xxix

It remains to say a few words as to the Mssj
referred to. Korn believes that all existing MSS.
are derived from an archetype which itself repre-l
sented 1 second recensicn of the poem, made towards
the end cl the eighth century. This archetype,
which is most nearly reproduced by the Codex
Marcianus (Μ), was itself not free from corruption·
and interpolation. But all other cornplete cr nearly
complete MSS. represent a still later recension‚ in
which the process ο1 interpolation has gone much ⁹
further. 01 these, which are classed as 0111111111- ι
podati, the oldest and most valuable is Laurentianus 1
(1. or λ), in the laurentian Library at Florence.
This is of the eleventh or twellth century. 01 the ¹
two others collated by Korn, Amplonianus (Ecr ε) 1..

century, and preserved respectively.at Erfurt and
(iopenhagen the former is more extensively inter-
polated‚ while the latter approximates to L. The- i
Codex Marcianus( formerly in the Dominican Ocn-
vent of St.. Mark 11 11011111,2 111 now in the
Laurentian Library, contains the poem as far 11 μ
