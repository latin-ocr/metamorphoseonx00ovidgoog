INTRODUOTION xxiii
hatred by shying his eleven brothers, one of them,

Periclymenus, in spite of his Protean power of
changing his shape at will.

Nor is this the only form of transition repeatedly
adopted by Ovid. Another method is to introduce
storias as told by spectatore, sometimes to convince
the incredulons‚ sometimes, like the story of Aesacus
already mentioned, because some similarity in the
catastrophe prompta their recollection. Pirithous
doubts the metamorphosis ol Perimele narrated by
Achelous,1 but is silenced by Lelex, who relates the
story of Baucis and Philemon, whereupon Achelous
himself gives further proof of the divine power. The
fate of Niobe recalls another instance of Latona’s
vengeance‚² the transformation to frogs of the Lycian
peasants who insulted her, and again the fate of
Marsyae, flayed alive by her son Apollo and metu
morphosed to a river. Or a story is told within a
story by way of warning or encouragement,⁸ The
crow endeavours to deter the raven from revealing
to Apollo the faithlessness of Coronis, by relating the
disgrace inflicted by Pallas upon herself for a like
indiscretion. Sometimes a jonrney gives occasion for
adventures or allows the Introduction ol local
legende,⁴ such as the historias of Scylla, the Sibyl,

² VIII. 614. ² VI. 316.

³As the storius of Galatea XIII. 740, and of Iphis and
Anaxamte XIV. 698.

⁴These local legenda are sometimes very briefly told, like
that of the Molossian king, XIII. 717. Anotable instance of
this is in Vll. 350, where seventeen stories are mentioned in
fifty-Iourlines.
