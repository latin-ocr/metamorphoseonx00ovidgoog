leuconoe's turn comes next, and she chooses for
subject the love of the Son-god lor Leucothoe, e
passion inflicted upon him by Venus for his betrayul
to Vuloan of her own intrigue with Mers. He visits
Leucothoe in the likeness of Eurynome her mother,
but his old love Clytie detecte the disguise, ond tells
the secret to Leucothoc’s father Orchamus. He in
anger buries his daughter ulive, and the god, after
vainly endeavouring to revive her, pours nectar upon

the place, whence springs a fragrant shrub. Clytie's

Minyeides, who will be overtaken by a fate no less
marvellous:
