while benesth the suriees

‘Groves homes, towns the wondering Nereide visust

Io transformed to a heiier1 follows her sistere

Their prone, end Joys to ieel their sondling heuds.
Some ethered herbs her iether prodere—mute,
She liegllls and wets with teers his honoured palm,

And longs for words to esk his eid, end tell

Her name, her sorrovvs All she cen—her hoof,

Unskilsul,1n the send contrives to trare

Some letters rude, which hiut the wretched tele
ι Of this her form transformed'

ln the conflagration oi Phaeth0n2

Withdrovs, by hest o’ermestered,’

ior Phaethon hides his iace ior a day, but the world

is not thereby leit in darkness:

When Phaethusa, eldest oi the Heliades, feels herself

stiffening to o tree,⁴

Stert trng took sudden root, end strove in vain
For motion to her aid. The third, her heir
